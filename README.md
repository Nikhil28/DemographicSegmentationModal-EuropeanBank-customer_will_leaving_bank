# DemographicSegmentationModal-EuropeanBank-customer_will_leave_bank

Here we have frictional un-real but realistic dataset of an European Bank. Our goal is to create <b>Demographic Segmentation Modal</b> to tell the bank which of their customers are at the highest risk of leaving the bank.

For lot of <b>Customer Centric Organization</b> this is going to be valuable to identify whether customer will get the loan, credit card, leave the bank, etc.

Hope everthing is setup in your machine to run this Python code and few instalation process you under <a href="https://github.com/Nikhil28/DemographicSegmentationModal-EuropeanBank-customer_will_leaving_bank/blob/master/ann/Installations_Instructions.pdf" rel="nofollow">Installations Instructions PDF</a>


Download the folder ann, understand and run this code. Concept will be same where as the code is avilable in Python and definately scope of improvement. I tried to comment and mantain code very well but sill if you have any query ping <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrnikhilgupta/" rel="nofollow">me</a></em>.

<h3>Variable Notes</h3>

<b>Geography</b> -> Country where customer belongs to<br>
<b>Credit Score</b> Credit points score by user on different bases<br>
<b>Gender</b> -> Male or Female<br>
<b>Age</b> -> Age of the customer<br>
<b>Tenure</b> -> Time period till what customer belongs to that bank<br>
<b>Balance</b> -> At present amount avilable in the customers account<br>
<b>Number of Products</b> -> Credit card, debit card, etc<br>
<b>Has Credit Card</b> -> Customer has credit card or not<br>
<b>Is Active Member</b> -> Customer is an active member of the bank<br>
<b>Estimated Salary</b> -> Bank as evaluated estimated salary of every person<br>

In this problem we have a <b>Single New Observation</b> to predict whether customer with the following informations will leave the bank or not.

<pre>
<b>Geography:</b> France
<b>Credit Score:</b> 600
<b>Gender:</b> Male
<b>Age:</b> 40
<b>Tenure:</b> 3
<b>Balance:</b> 60000
<b>Number of Products:</b> 2
<b>Has Credit Card:</b> Yes
<b>Is Active Member:</b> Yes
<b>Estimated Salary:</b> 50000
</pre>

Confusion Matrix dataset to describe the performance of a classification model.
True Negative (TN) = 1528
False Negative (FN) = 205
False Positive (FP) = 67
True Positive (TP) = 200

You will score <b>+86%</b> in this particular problem for now.
